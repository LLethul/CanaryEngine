With a built in networking structure thats powerful and super performant, and a package manager that is built into studio, setting up CanaryEngine and using it should be a breeze. One of the main selling points of the framework is that many of the current frameworks like Knit are kind of confusing to use and set up, along with the fact that it doesn\'t support instances as packages. Nothing special here, CanaryEngine was only designed to organize and manage at scale.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"Tutorials/customsignals":{"id":"Tutorials/customsignals","title":"Signals","description":"CanaryEngine\'s signal system is essentially the successor of the well-known BindableEvent, but no special quirks come with it. Some of these issues include common memory leaks and overall slowness. Our signal implementation simply uses @stravant\'s signal implementation which solely relies on the task scheduler to work.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"Tutorials/networking":{"id":"Tutorials/networking","title":"Networking","description":"CanaryEngine\'s networking system is very straightforward compared to some of the other game frameworks out there. It uses a method which reduces bandwidth by a lot, and in turn will help your game lag less. This document serves as a simple tutorial on the networking system, explaining all the functionality available in the NetworkController.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"Tutorials/packages":{"id":"Tutorials/packages","title":"Package System","description":"One of Canary\'s greatest strengths is the built in package system, which allows for many more oppurtunities. At the moment, we only have a function which checks the version of packages and returns the latest version, but a package manager in the plugin is very high up on the features list currently. Come back when we have finished the package manager for more info!","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"Tutorials/structure":{"id":"Tutorials/structure","title":"File Structure","description":"The CanaryEngine file structure aims to be easy to understand, easy to edit, and extremely customizable.
