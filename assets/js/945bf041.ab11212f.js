You can now Assert values, and clear the output / cache lists. Calling debug also adds items to the cache list.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Create Topbar Icons with UIShelf\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new library UIShelf, you can now create topbar icons that mimic the CoreGui 1:1. We\'ve taken into account every single design aspect that the top bar button has and have been able to replicate it.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Network Controller Improvements\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can now set a client timeout for network controllers, allowing you to minimize timeout errors. This should fix most of the issues you guys have been having as of late.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Documentation Improvements\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have improved the documentation site! Coming with 4 new detailed tutorials, more API documentation, and this new blog! We will post engine recaps like this here and they will be exclusive to this website. New API sections have also been added to help organize it.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Plugin Improvements\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have improved the plugin a little bit (no rebuild yet) and have stopped a few more bugs from popping up. BridgeNet has also been updated to 0.5.4. We are planning lots more for the future, and we will be adding the HintService library soon once it is revamped.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\'re interested in contributing, please make a PR on our GitHub!"},{"id":"enginerecap-july2023","metadata":{"permalink":"/CanaryEngine/blog/enginerecap-july2023","editUrl":"https://github.com/canary-development/CanaryEngine/edit/main/blog/2023-07-31-engine-recap-july-2023.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-31-engine-recap-july-2023.md","title":"Engine Recap - July 2023","description":"Hi developers,","date":"2023-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 31, 2023","tags":[{"label":"canaryengine","permalink":"/CanaryEngine/blog/tags/canaryengine"},{"label":"recap","permalink":"/CanaryEngine/blog/tags/recap"}],"readingTime":1.305,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"James","title":"Canary Development","url":"https://github.com/lolmansReturn","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/119134081?v=4","key":"james"},{"name":"koxx12","title":"Contributor","url":"https://github.com/koxx12-dev","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80456351?v=4","key":"contributor-koxx12"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"enginerecap-july2023","title":"Engine Recap - July 2023","authors":["james","contributor-koxx12"],"tags":["canaryengine","recap"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Engine Recap - August 2023","permalink":"/CanaryEngine/blog/enginerecap-august2023"},"nextItem":{"title":"Engine Recap - June 2023","permalink":"/CanaryEngine/blog/enginerecap-june2023"}},"content":"**Hi developers,**\\r\\n\\r\\nWith engine update 3.2.4, we have released lots of changes based on feedback, and lots of long time bug fixes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n### Anonymous Signals\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst off, we have added the `AnonymousSignal` API thanks to @koxx12. This allows you to create signals that are only referenced once, and not cached.\\r\\n\\r\\n```lua\\r\\nlocal MyNewAnonymousSignal = CanaryEngine.CreateAnonymousSignal() -- this is the only reference held to the signal controller!\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Updated Benchmark Library\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have updated the `Benchmark` library to provide more accurate information, and more useful information such as longest benchmark and shortest. This will allow you to get a more in-depth result of your testing, allowing you to create even better code!\\r\\n\\r\\n### EngineReplicatedFirst\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have added a folder for `ReplicatedFirst`! Now you can have custom loader scripts, or startup scripts still run without being deattached from the framework. This also lets us execute our next feature...\\r\\n\\r\\n### Engine Loader\\r\\n\\r\\nIntroducing the engine loader! This is a custom loading screen made directly for CanaryEngine, and it functions better in performance than most loading screens. It also shares extensive info, like the current asset completed percentage, and even failed assets once finished! You can view the API under **Engine API > EngineLoader**.\\r\\n\\r\\n### `roblox-ts` Typings\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can now use CanaryEngine with the new `roblox-ts` typings. Lots of people requested this feature and it is finally here!\\r\\n\\r\\n### Other Improvements\\r\\n\\r\\n* Improves types\\r\\n* Fixes plugin bugs\\r\\n* Fixes `SignalController`s not working *at all*\\r\\n* Fixes other small bugs\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\'re interested in contributing, please make a PR on our GitHub!"},{"id":"enginerecap-june2023","metadata":{"permalink":"/CanaryEngine/blog/enginerecap-june2023","editUrl":"https://github.com/canary-development/CanaryEngine/edit/main/blog/2023-06-28-engine-recap-june-2023.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-28-engine-recap-june-2023.md","title":"Engine Recap - June 2023","description":"Hi developers,","date":"2023-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 28, 2023","tags":[{"label":"canaryengine","permalink":"/CanaryEngine/blog/tags/canaryengine"},{"label":"recap","permalink":"/CanaryEngine/blog/tags/recap"}],"readingTime":1.3,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"James","title":"Canary Development","url":"https://github.com/lolmansReturn","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/119134081?v=4","key":"james"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"enginerecap-june2023","title":"Engine Recap - June 2023","authors":["james"],"tags":["canaryengine","recap"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Engine Recap - July 2023","permalink":"/CanaryEngine/blog/enginerecap-july2023"}},"content":"**Hi developers,**\\r\\n\\r\\nWith engine update 3.0.0, a lot of features have been revamped. Lots of stuff comes with this update, including the new and improved plugin!\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n### New Plugin\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the last plugin was just a few buttons, we wanted to do a UI approach instead. This allows us to improve the UX of the plugin, and make it more advanced then ever. Some new features include specific package installation and auto updating.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Reworked Data Saving\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the new data saving methods, it\'s even easier to save data for your game. The code has been improved to be more efficient, and it now has better API methods than previously. Custom key patterns are also now a thing, along with data editing via tables instead of get/set methods.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Reworked Networking\\r\\n\\r\\nThe networking system has been completely changed, and are NetworkControllers are no longer called NetworkSignals. This is mainly because they now support server invocation, and have a lot more methods than previously.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Name Param for `CreateSignal`\\r\\n\\r\\nPreviously, `CanaryEngine.CreateSignal` would not allow you to take in names, which requires you to create a custom caching system. This update changes that and you can now declare a name for your signals. All signals can now be accessed through scripts in the same environment as long as the names are matching.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Entirely New Documentation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe documentation has been **completely** revamped, and now is hosted on a moonwave site. All API methods and properties are now documented.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\'re interested in contributing, please make a PR on our GitHub!"}]}')}}]);
