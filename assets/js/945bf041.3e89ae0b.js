You can now Assert values, and clear the output / cache lists. Calling debug also adds items to the cache list.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Create Topbar Icons with UIShelf\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new library UIShelf, you can now create topbar icons that mimic the CoreGui 1:1. We\'ve taken into account every single design aspect that the top bar button has and have been able to replicate it.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Network Controller Improvements\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can now set a client timeout for network controllers, allowing you to minimize timeout errors. This should fix most of the issues you guys have been having as of late.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Documentation Improvements\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have improved the documentation site! Coming with 4 new detailed tutorials, more API documentation, and this new blog! We will post engine recaps like this here and they will be exclusive to this website. New API sections have also been added to help organize it.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Plugin Improvements\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have improved the plugin a little bit (no rebuild yet) and have stopped a few more bugs from popping up. BridgeNet has also been updated to 0.5.4. We are planning lots more for the future, and we will be adding the HintService library soon once it is revamped.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\'re interested in contributing, please make a PR on our GitHub!"},{"id":"enginerecap-july2023","metadata":{"permalink":"/CanaryEngine/blog/enginerecap-july2023","editUrl":"https://github.com/canary-development/CanaryEngine/edit/main/blog/2023-07-31-engine-recap-july-2023.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-31-engine-recap-july-2023.md","title":"Engine Recap - July 2023","description":"Hi developers,","date":"2023-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 31, 2023","tags":[{"label":"canaryengine","permalink":"/CanaryEngine/blog/tags/canaryengine"},{"label":"recap","permalink":"/CanaryEngine/blog/tags/recap"}],"readingTime":1.185,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"James","title":"Canary Development","url":"https://github.com/lolmansReturn","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/119134081?v=4","key":"james"},{"name":"koxx12","title":"Contributor","url":"https://github.com/koxx12-dev","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80456351?v=4","key":"contributor-koxx12"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"enginerecap-july2023","title":"Engine Recap - July 2023","authors":["james","contributor-koxx12"],"tags":["canaryengine","recap"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Engine Recap - August 2023","permalink":"/CanaryEngine/blog/enginerecap-august2023"}},"content":"**Hi developers,**\\r\\n\\r\\nWith engine update 3.2.4, we have released lots of changes based on feedback, and lots of long time bug fixes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n### Anonymous Signals\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst off, we have added the `AnonymousSignal` API thanks to @koxx12. This allows you to create signals that are only referenced once, and not cached.\\r\\n\\r\\n```lua\\r\\nlocal MyNewAnonymousSignal = CanaryEngine.CreateAnonymousSignal() -- this is the only reference held to the signal controller!\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Updated Benchmark Library\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have updated the `Benchmark` library to provide more accurate information, and more useful information such as longest benchmark and shortest. This will allow you to get a more in-depth result of your testing, allowing you to create even better code!\\r\\n\\r\\n### EngineReplicatedFirst\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have added a folder for `ReplicatedFirst`! Now you can have custom loader scripts, or startup scripts still run without being deattached from the framework. This also lets us execute our next feature...\\r\\n\\r\\n### Engine Loader\\r\\n\\r\\nIntroducing the engine loader! This is a custom loading screen made directly for CanaryEngine, and it functions better in performance than most loading screens. It also shares extensive info, like the current asset completed percentage, and even failed assets once finished! You can view the API under **Engine API > EngineLoader**.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Other Improvements\\r\\n\\r\\n* Improves types\\r\\n* Fixes plugin bugs\\r\\n* Fixes `SignalController`s not working *at all*\\r\\n* Fixes other small bugs\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\'re interested in contributing, please make a PR on our GitHub!"}]}')}}]);
