I've personally used it for all of my projects, and it works great despite the scale of each one. I designed the framework to have a super optimized networking and signal system. It combines the usage of @ffrostfall's BridgeNet2 and and @stravant's GoodSignal modules, which helps it be optimized by a ton. It also comes with many other libraries built in, such as @commitblue's BlueSerializer and the framework's own Utility, Benchmark, and Statistics modules. They each cover many of the edge cases that come up lots of times during the development process. A fine example of this is saving instances in datastores. It was made to be complex, but also easy to learn which is what mainly makes the framework stand out from the others. I have covered almost all of the API and libraries in our documentation, be sure to check that out before starting out with the framework. Our goal while creating this framework was to not intrude on the developers code, but instead let them customize their experience and give them basic tools along the way, such as the built-in networking system. I have found myself that this actually makes the process of developing a project way faster than before, and is just nicer to work with overall when stuff isn't practically shoved down your throat.

The vendor folder should automatically be referenced in your new package, from there you can insert dependencies of your package inside of vendor, and then import them inside the package. Another benefit to using a vendor folder is a less messy file structure, as packages just referencing others back and forth can start to be a huge problem for anyones codebase.

Though, to first create a new controller, use the .CreateNetworkController function in the context specific framework. In this tutorial, we assume the server is trying to send information to the client. Here's an example of how you would set up the network controller: local SendInfoNetwork = CanaryEngineServer.CreateNetworkController(&quot;SendInfoNetwork&quot;) print(SendInfoNetwork.Name) -- Output: SendInfoNetwork  Now lets set up the network controller to be client-sided as well: local SendInfoNetwork = CanaryEngineClient.CreateNetworkController(&quot;SendInfoNetwork&quot;)  Now lets continue this code and make it so it can recieve info from the server: local SendInfoNetwork = CanaryEngineClient.CreateNetworkController(&quot;SendInfoNetwork&quot;) SendInfoNetwork:Connect(function(data) print(data) end)  Though, we have a problem. SendInfoNetwork is not recieving anything on the client if nothing is being fired from the server. To pass data through the network controller, you can use NetworkController:Fire. Here's how we would do that on the server: local SendInfoNetwork = CanaryEngineServer.CreateNetworkController(&quot;SendInfoNetwork&quot;) local PlayerService = game:GetService(&quot;Players&quot;) print(SendInfoNetwork.Name) -- Output: SendInfoNetwork SendInfoNetwork:FireAll({ -- When sending data on the server, you must pass a player argument. In this example though, we are firing to all players. &quot;Sent through a&quot;, &quot;Network controller!&quot; })  When we start the script, we should then see the the name in the output, and also see the following in the client output: { &quot;Sent through a&quot;, &quot;Network controller!&quot; }  Please keep in mind that these can be used for many other things other than just passing strings through, also that if you just have a single piece of data you can send it through the fire method without wrapping it in a table. Though, keep in mind that the data you recieve will always be a table no matter how you pass the data originally. danger You can in fact pass dictionaries through fire functions, but keep in mind these are bandwith-heavy and should be arrays instead. We also have available the Fire, FireExcept and SetRateLimit functions. Each of them are documented in their own API page.

For now, we only support invoking the server as invoking the client is fairly useless at this point. If you need this functionality, you can use the remote event part of the network controllers. You may already know how to set up the basic network controller, so here's just a basic example of the client asking the server for a value: Server:​ local ValueGetNetwork = CanaryEngineServer.CreateNetworkController(&quot;ValueGetNetwork&quot;) ValueGetNetwork:OnInvoke(function(sender, data) print(sender.Name) -- The player who sent the invoke's name if data[1] then return &quot;yes&quot; -- We must return a value here, or it will error else return &quot;no&quot; end end)  Client:​ Now on the client, we can invoke the server using NetworkController:InvokeAsync. We must send a boolean through to be checked on invoked. local ValueGetNetwork = CanaryEngineClient.CreateNetworkController(&quot;ValueGetNetwork&quot;) print(ValueGetNetwork:InvokeAsync(true)) -- When the value is recieved, this should return &quot;yes&quot; according to the server code.  Obviously, this isn't quite a valid use case for invoking the server, but some valid use cases include asking the server for a specific value. What we are doing here is just a waste of bandwidth, but for the sake of the tutorial I will be including this.

It's basically just a GlobalDataStore, but instead of managing keys, it manages individual profiles instead. These profiles are assigned to a unique ID, so they can be assigned to the player's UserId, or it can be it's own thing. Though, first, lets create a new ProfileStore using the DataService.CreateProfileStore function: local DataService = CanaryEngineServer.Data local MyNewDataStore = DataService.CreateProfileStore(&quot;MyProfileStore&quot;, {Cash = 100, Gems = 5, Items = {&quot;Wooden Sword&quot;}})  After this, you can declare the key pattern if you want to. This is optional though, and the default is 'user_%d' for compatibility with older versions. Though, I recommend just changing to '%d', so it only contains the player's UserId. local DataService = CanaryEngineServer.Data local MyNewDataStore = DataService.CreateProfileStore(&quot;MyProfileStore&quot;, {Cash = 100, Gems = 5, Items = {&quot;Wooden Sword&quot;}}, &quot;%d&quot;) -- Change the pattern if you want to, it's better for usage  Now, we can detect when the player joins, and when they do, we can load in their data by using ProfileStoreObject:LoadProfileAsync. This will load in the profile and allow you to interact with the data. Here's how you would do that: local DataService = CanaryEngineServer.Data local PlayerService = game:GetService(&quot;Players&quot;) local MyNewDataStore = DataService.CreateProfileStore(&quot;MyProfileStore&quot;, {Cash = 100, Gems = 5, Items = {&quot;Wooden Sword&quot;}}, &quot;%d&quot;) -- // Functions local function PlayerAdded(player) local PlayerProfile = MyNewDataStore:LoadProfileAsync(player) -- Load the profile, you can also add an optional `reconcile` argument which reconciles the data end PlayerService.PlayerAdded:Connect(PlayerAdded)  Now sometimes, the player will join before the server script runs. To fix this, we can loop through all of the players after we listen to the player added event, then run the player added function: local DataService = CanaryEngineServer.Data local PlayerService = game:GetService(&quot;Players&quot;) local MyNewDataStore = DataService.CreateProfileStore(&quot;MyProfileStore&quot;, {Cash = 100, Gems = 5, Items = {&quot;Wooden Sword&quot;}}, &quot;%d&quot;) -- // Functions local function PlayerAdded(player) local PlayerProfile = MyNewDataStore:LoadProfileAsync(player) end PlayerService.PlayerAdded:Connect(PlayerAdded) for _, player in PlayerService:GetPlayers() do task.spawn(PlayerAdded, player) end  Now we are all set! But first, we have to make sure to unclaim the session lock when the player leaves. Doing this is pretty simple, just add this to your script: PlayerService.PlayerRemoving:Connect(function(player) MyNewDataStore:UnclaimSessionLock(player) end)  "},{"title":"Profiles​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Data Management","url":"/CanaryEngine/docs/tutorials/datastoring#profiles","content":"Now we can get started on profiles. As explained in the introduction, profiles are essentially the successor to datastore keys. These are much easier to use and make the process of data saving so much easier. Setting the data here is as simple as editing a table. No getter or setter functions, you can make your own. What we will do first is get the data we can edit from the profile. In order to do this, you must call PlayerProfile:GetProfileData. local function PlayerAdded(player) local PlayerProfile = MyNewDataStore:LoadProfileAsync(player) local ProfileData = PlayerProfile:GetProfileData() print(ProfileData) -- Output: {Cash = 100, Gems = 5, Items = {&quot;Wooden Sword&quot;}} end  Now that we have verified that our code is indeed working, we can now edit the values in the profile data dictionary as so: local function PlayerAdded(player) local PlayerProfile = MyNewDataStore:LoadProfileAsync(player) local ProfileData = PlayerProfile:GetProfileData() print(ProfileData) -- Output: {Cash = 100, Gems = 5, Items = {&quot;Wooden Sword&quot;}} table.insert(ProfileData.Items, &quot;Iron Sword&quot;) print(ProfileData) -- Output: {Cash = 100, Gems = 5, Items = {&quot;Wooden Sword&quot;, &quot;Iron Sword&quot;}} end  We can do quite a bit with this, such as increase the user's cash each time they join, or even remove specific items. When we join back, the iron sword should persist if you set up the profile store correctly. Though, there is one more thing you should learn: GlobalKeys.

There's really only 3 functions to learn, so it should be pretty straightforward to learn. To start, we can create and setup our profile store just as how we did previously: local DataService = CanaryEngineServer.Data local PlayerService = game:GetService(&quot;Players&quot;) local MyNewDataStore = DataService.CreateProfileStore(&quot;MyProfileStore&quot;, {Cash = 100, Gems = 5, Items = {&quot;Wooden Sword&quot;}}, &quot;%d&quot;) -- // Functions local function PlayerAdded(player) local PlayerProfile = MyNewDataStore:LoadProfileAsync(player) end PlayerService.PlayerRemoving:Connect(function(player) MyNewDataStore:UnclaimSessionLock(player) end) PlayerService.PlayerAdded:Connect(PlayerAdded) for _, player in PlayerService:GetPlayers() do task.spawn(PlayerAdded, player) end  First, in our PlayerAdded function, lets send a new global key out to ourselves by using the ProfileStoreObject:SetGlobalKeyAsync method: local function PlayerAdded(player) local PlayerProfile = MyNewDataStore:LoadProfileAsync(player) MyNewDataStore:SetGlobalKeyAsync(player.UserId, &quot;GlobalKeyTest&quot;, &quot;somerandomstringdata&quot;) -- The first argument is the player who is recieving it, and the others are the key name followed by the value end  To listen when the player recieves a new key in-game, you can use the ProfileObject.GlobalKeyAdded event, it will fire when a new key is added: local function PlayerAdded(player) local PlayerProfile = MyNewDataStore:LoadProfileAsync(player) PlayerProfile.GlobalKeyAdded:Connect(function(data) print(data[1]) -- Output: {Key = &quot;GlobalKeyTest&quot;, Value = {this = &quot;is a test&quot;}, KeyId = 1} end) MyNewDataStore:SetGlobalKeyAsync(player.UserId, &quot;GlobalKeyTest&quot;, &quot;somerandomstringdata&quot;) end  Please note that when doing this, you must wait around 60 seconds for the key to be recieved. Though next, we should setup a way for us to recieve keys that we got when were offline. In order to do this, you can use the ProfileObject:GetGlobalKeys method, it returns a table of global keys that we can loop through: local function PlayerAdded(player) local PlayerProfile = MyNewDataStore:LoadProfileAsync(player) for _, globalKey in PlayerProfile:GetGlobalKeys() do print(globalKey.Key, &quot;:&quot;, globalKey.Value) -- Output: {Key = &quot;GlobalKeyTest&quot;, Value = &quot;somerandomstringdata&quot;, KeyId = 1} end PlayerProfile.GlobalKeyAdded:Connect(function(data) print(data[1]) -- Output: {Key = &quot;GlobalKeyTest&quot;, Value = &quot;somerandomstringdata&quot;, KeyId = 2} end) MyNewDataStore:SetGlobalKeyAsync(player.UserId, &quot;GlobalKeyTest&quot;, &quot;somerandomstringdata&quot;) end  Please do note that there is a difference between GlobalKey's and regular keys.

The only acception here is with the EngineScripts folder, you cannot have a replicated script which runs both client and server sided as of writing this. You can organize these folders however you want, by adding new folders inside and placing new content inside. Please note that the folders already inside each media folder is just a template for easy startups, this does not have to be kept the way it is. Another feature of CanaryEngine is the way you can create your own file structure, in the plugin, all you have to do is select the destination folders for each folder that is required. (eg: Media, Packages, and Scripts). Doing this also allows you to organize more of your own way. Have lots of libraries you need to store?
