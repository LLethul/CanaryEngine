Here are a few notable features that make CanaryEngine standout: Type Safe - Fully compatible with Roblox’s intellisense and Roblox LSP. Simple API - There is very little API to interact with, therefore it shouldn’t take long to get used it! Fully Documented - All functions in the main module are fully documented, along with the types Easy Setup - Simply require the module on the server, and your game will be set up automatically. Nicely Organized - There are folders such as Scripts, Packages, and Media each with their own client, server, and shared (later referred to as replicated) folders. Lightweight - The framework is really lightweight, with only about 4 modules needed to startup and function, totaling to ~400 lines of code (including function documentation). Secure - The framework is super secure, minimizing as much client code as possible and when not needed. The current networking library that is being used is also super secure and partially immune to exploits such as RemoteSpy Easy Modding - Not completely satisfied with the framework I have provided you with?

For example, CanaryEngine/Media/Server shares the same behavior with ServerStorage. In this case, replicated shares behavior with ReplicatedStorage. The only acception here is with the CanaryEngine/Scripts folder, you cannot have a replicated script which runs both client and server sided as of writing this. You can organize these folders however you want, by adding new folders inside and placing new content inside. Please note that the folders already inside each media folder is just a template for easy startups, this does not have to be kept the way it is. As a conclusion, do not move any folders that have already been placed where they are (aside from the folders inside of media), as it will cause CanaryEngine to error.

Though, to first create a new controller, use the .CreateNetworkController function in the context specific framework. In this tutorial, we assume the server is trying to send information to the client. Here's an example of how you would set up the network controller: local SendInfoNetwork = CanaryEngineServer.CreateNetworkController(&quot;SendInfoNetwork&quot;) print(SendInfoNetwork.Name) -- Output: SendInfoNetwork  Now lets set up the network controller to be client-sided as well: local SendInfoNetwork = CanaryEngineClient.CreateNetworkController(&quot;SendInfoNetwork&quot;)  Now lets continue this code and make it so it can recieve info from the server: local SendInfoNetwork = CanaryEngineClient.CreateNetworkSignal(&quot;SendInfoNetwork&quot;) SendInfoNetwork:Connect(function(data) print(data) end)  Though, we have a problem. SendInfoNetwork is not recieving anything on the client if nothing is being fired from the server. To pass data through the network controller, you can use NetworkController:Fire. Here's how we would do that on the server: local SendInfoNetwork = CanaryEngineServer.CreateNetworkController(&quot;SendInfoNetwork&quot;) local PlayerService = game:GetService(&quot;Players&quot;) print(SendInfoNetwork.Name) -- Output: SendInfoNetwork SendInfoNetwork:Fire(PlayerService:GetPlayers(), { -- When sending data on the server, you must pass a player argument. This can be a single player or a table of players. In this situation, we use Players:GetPlayers to send this to all players. &quot;Sent through a&quot;, &quot;RemoteEvent&quot; })  When we start the script, we should then see the the name in the output, and also see the following in the client output: { &quot;Sent through a&quot;, &quot;RemoteEvent&quot; }  Please keep in mind that these can be used for many other things other than just passing strings through, also that if you just have a single piece of data you can send it through the fire method without wrapping it in a table. Though, keep in mind that the data you recieve will always be a table no matter how you pass the data originally. "},{"title":"RemoteFunctions​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Networking","url":"/CanaryEngine/docs/Tutorials/networking#remotefunctions","content":"The RemoteFunction is a fairly straightforward way of sending and recieving data at the same time. For now, we only support invoking the server as invoking the client is fairly useless at this point. If you need this functionality, you can use the remote event part of the network controllers. You may already know how to set up the basic network controller, so here's just a basic example of the client asking the server for a value: Server:​ local ValueGetNetwork = CanaryEngineServer.CreateNetworkController(&quot;ValueGetNetwork&quot;) ValueGetNetwork:OnInvoke(function(sender, data) print(sender.Name) -- The player who sent the invoke's name if data[1] then return &quot;yes&quot; -- We must return a value here, or it will error else return &quot;no&quot; end end)  Client:​ Now on the client, we can invoke the server using NetworkController:InvokeAsync. We must send a boolean through to be checked on invoked. local ValueGetNetwork = CanaryEngineClient.CreateNetworkController(&quot;ValueGetNetwork&quot;) print(ValueGetNetwork:InvokeAsync(true)) -- When the value is recieved, this should return &quot;yes&quot; according to the server code.  Obviously, this isn't quite a valid use case for invoking the server, but some valid use cases include asking the server for a specific value. What we are doing here is just a waste of bandwidth, but for the sake of the tutorial I will be including this. "}]
