            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Hi developers,</strong></p><p>With engine update 3.3.5, we have gathered lots of feedback by our users and fixed bugs related to networking.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="more-debugger-resources">More Debugger Resources<a href="#more-debugger-resources" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to More Debugger Resources" title="Direct link to More Debugger Resources">​</a></h3><p>We have added 2 new functions and 1 new feature to the debug API. You can now Assert values, and clear the output / cache lists. Calling debug also adds items to the cache list.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="create-topbar-icons-with-uishelf">Create Topbar Icons with UIShelf<a href="#create-topbar-icons-with-uishelf" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Create Topbar Icons with UIShelf" title="Direct link to Create Topbar Icons with UIShelf">​</a></h3><p>The new library UIShelf, you can now create topbar icons that mimic the CoreGui 1:1. We've taken into account every single design aspect that the top bar button has and have been able to replicate it.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="network-controller-improvements">Network Controller Improvements<a href="#network-controller-improvements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Network Controller Improvements" title="Direct link to Network Controller Improvements">​</a></h3><p>You can now set a client timeout for network controllers, allowing you to minimize timeout errors. This should fix most of the issues you guys have been having as of late.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="documentation-improvements">Documentation Improvements<a href="#documentation-improvements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Documentation Improvements" title="Direct link to Documentation Improvements">​</a></h3><p>We have improved the documentation site! Coming with 4 new detailed tutorials, more API documentation, and this new blog! We will post engine recaps like this here and they will be exclusive to this website. New API sections have also been added to help organize it.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="plugin-improvements">Plugin Improvements<a href="#plugin-improvements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Plugin Improvements" title="Direct link to Plugin Improvements">​</a></h3><p>We have improved the plugin a little bit (no rebuild yet) and have stopped a few more bugs from popping up. BridgeNet has also been updated to 0.5.4. We are planning lots more for the future, and we will be adding the HintService library soon once it is revamped.</p><hr><p>If you're interested in contributing, please make a PR on our GitHub!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Hi developers,</strong></p><p>With engine update 3.0.0, a lot of features have been revamped. Lots of stuff comes with this update, including the new and improved plugin!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-plugin">New Plugin<a href="#new-plugin" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New Plugin" title="Direct link to New Plugin">​</a></h3><p>Since the last plugin was just a few buttons, we wanted to do a UI approach instead. This allows us to improve the UX of the plugin, and make it more advanced then ever. Some new features include specific package installation and auto updating.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reworked-data-saving">Reworked Data Saving<a href="#reworked-data-saving" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reworked Data Saving" title="Direct link to Reworked Data Saving">​</a></h3><p>With the new data saving methods, it's even easier to save data for your game. The code has been improved to be more efficient, and it now has better API methods than previously. Custom key patterns are also now a thing, along with data editing via tables instead of get/set methods.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reworked-networking">Reworked Networking<a href="#reworked-networking" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reworked Networking" title="Direct link to Reworked Networking">​</a></h3><p>The networking system has been completely changed, and are NetworkControllers are no longer called NetworkSignals. This is mainly because they now support server invocation, and have a lot more methods than previously.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="name-param-for-createsignal">Name Param for <code>CreateSignal</code><a href="#name-param-for-createsignal" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to name-param-for-createsignal" title="Direct link to name-param-for-createsignal">​</a></h3><p>Previously, <code>CanaryEngine.CreateSignal</code> would not allow you to take in names, which requires you to create a custom caching system. This update changes that and you can now declare a name for your signals. All signals can now be accessed through scripts in the same environment as long as the names are matching.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="entirely-new-documentation">Entirely New Documentation<a href="#entirely-new-documentation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Entirely New Documentation" title="Direct link to Entirely New Documentation">​</a></h3><p>The documentation has been <strong>completely</strong> revamped, and now is hosted on a moonwave site. All API methods and properties are now documented.</p><hr><p>If you're interested in contributing, please make a PR on our GitHub!</p>]]></content:encoded>
